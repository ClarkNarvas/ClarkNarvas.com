For as long as I can remember, I have always been an overthinking person. Imagination occupied my life, from visualising new design ideas to creating fake conversations in my head. **I’ve always thought of it as “the way it is” because I’ve never been able to find the button at the back of the TV to turn off the noise.**

But recently, I’ve *thought* that perhaps now is the time to turn off the noise, or rather, turn down the volume so I can pay attention to the world around me more deeply.

**My mind has turned into a form of escapism**, one that creates unnecessary emotions and thinks too deeply into the future when really, all that is needed is what is happening right now. It’s also quite a dangerous creature when I’m not able to control it: I make unwise decisions, self-sabotage and ruin my routine.

### Causes of my overthinking

* I’ve always wanted to fix issues. Sometimes I think about trying to solve problems out of my control.
* The unintentional mind seems to want to occupy as long as possible. It feels like a constant tug of war.
* When I do get into an intentional mind flow, I always end up slipping back into the rabbit hole and struggling to find a way out.


### Ways I've been trying to turn down the volume (some I need to start doing again)

* **🙏🏼 Meditation:** Putting aside some time to be silent and focus on my body helps me put myself at ease. I’ve been meditating every day for at least 5 minutes since February 2021 🏅 and it’s really worked wonders to make me feel calmer.

* **😴 Sleeping early:** Sleeping early is like a little message to myself that I need to be more intentional the next day, and most of the time, it works really well in achieving calm and discipline.

* **🧠 Getting away from endless content consumption, especially in the morning:** My mind feels less fatigued when I don’t put headphones on and scroll through TikToks in the morning. Fatigue ruins my day and sometimes, puts me into a mindless state.
