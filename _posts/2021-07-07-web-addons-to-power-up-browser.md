_‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an add-on for that‚Äù_

I‚Äôve started using my web browser more than I have usually done in the past few years. You probably have too! 

With many services and tools that would have been programs 5 years ago moving exclusively onto the web, your web browser has never been more important. 

Here are some cross-browser web extensions that will level-up your web browsing experience to the max.

### An add-on that will make your web experience 10x more wholesome (cats included!)

Want something to cheer you up?

[Tabby Cat](https://tabbycats.club/) is a web extension that replaces your new tab page with adorable cartoon cats. Everytime you create a new tab, an adorable new cat will pop up with an equally adorable name.

These virtual cats can move, sleep and you‚Äôre able to pet them! If you get too attached to them, you can create snapshots of them and save them.

If you're not fond of cats, there are other animal options ranging from 'Lil Doggo' to 'Tuxido Birb'.

### An add-on that will secure your web browsing experience

[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) is basically what it says on the tin, it allows you to browse the internet securely using TLS (HTTPS) everywhere. 

It blocks you from using sites without TLS which makes your internet experience encrypted and more secure. This prevents hackers from executing man-in-the-middle attacks and potentially stealing your personal information without your knowledge.

### An add-on that allows you to enhance your concentration while on the web

{% include components/imagedownscale.html url="/assets/blogposts/web-addons/lock-screen-bc405cbc0c8f0b5d9a4212543af54265.png" alt="Intention addon" %}

Since COVID started, I‚Äôve been trying to make my digital use more intentional. From screen time limits to simply locking myself out for a while, this is one of my favourite, less obtrusive tools. 

[Intention](https://www.getintention.com/) allows you to mark distracting websites, it would then show a pop up every 5 minutes when you‚Äôre on those sites asking if you want to keep using it. For me, this is really helpful when I‚Äôm stuck in an endless, lifeless Twitter scroll.

It‚Äôs created single-handedly by DK The Human and he seems like a really talented developer with a great blog!

### An add-on that pops out, quite literally.

Firefox users already have a pop-out video feature, but for those using Chromium based browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave), Google has a [picture-in-picture video](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg) extension. 

It simply allows you to pop-out video away from a web page by clicking a button up in the toolbar. Quite straightforward, isn‚Äôt it?

### An add-on that lets you read things later.

Have you ever been in a situation where you find a good article but you don‚Äôt have time to read it? 

[Pocket by Mozilla](https://getpocket.com/en/about/) (the same people who make the Firefox browser) allows you to save articles into a list that you can look at later, sort of like the YouTube Watch Later feature. 

Create an account and you‚Äôll be able to start saving articles from the Pocket button on the toolbar. You can also do this using the Pocket app on the App Store and Google Play.

{% include components/legacy/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/web-addons/Screenshot 2021-07-07 at 18.21.33.png" alt="Mozilla Pocket app website" %}

While this may not be about the add-on, one eye catching feature from the app is the ability to make it read out the article for you. You could say everything is a podcast now!

These add-ons have allowed me to transform my web browser from ‚Äòjust any old web browser‚Äô into a literal swiss army knife of a program.
