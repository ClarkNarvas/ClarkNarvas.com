_‚ÄúWhat are you going to do today?‚Äù_

If you know me very well, you‚Äôd know I like to switch between to-do list apps (you could call it procrastination, I like to call it user testing üòâ). 

I started with Microsoft To-Do, and then I had phases of Google Tasks, Notion, Trello and Habitica. A few months back I decided to settle with Todoist, mainly because of it‚Äôs simple user interface (keep it simple, stupid) and the great implementation of features 

Right now, I‚Äôm using it day-to-day to try to get better habits and achieve goals before I return to school in September and I thought it would be cool to share to you all how I‚Äôve been using it. üëá

{% include components/heading.html text="A few features I love" %}

* Kanban Boards - It‚Äôs a feature copied and pasted from [Trello](https://trello.com/). The implementation is really good here, I love how it‚Äôs another type of view alongside the normal list. 

* Smart Language Detection - It can detect through what I write: the time, date or the number of occurrences I want a task to repeat without needing to go through a lot of context menus. It‚Äôs a really nifty feature that allows me to save time. 

* Priority Tasks - I use this to order my tasks and to eliminate excuses on what comes first.

* Karma - It gamifies tasks and is honestly just nice to look at.

### How I use Inbox

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.13.20.png" alt="My inbox with tasks in" description="Please, don't ask." %}

Inbox is where I put tasks specific to the day and don‚Äôt repeat. 

These tasks aren‚Äôt very complex or have any individual processes behind them, they‚Äôre bitesize reminders that simply remind me to do something _(eg. Bring bulletproof vest)_


### How I use Projects

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.13.45.png" alt="Ideas kanban board todoist" description="Kanban Boards are the best" %}

Many of them are organised as Kanban Boards in 3 sections: what I‚Äôm not doing, what I‚Äôm doing and what goal or task has been achieved. This might not work for every project and scenario but for what I‚Äôve been using Todoist for, this works really well. 

Unlike other to-do list apps, Todoist doesn't have a description feature. However, it does have a comments feature, which may not be as structured, but it at least gets the job done. 

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.13.54.png" alt="comment: big epiphany moment, wasting time" description="This is how I talk to myself." %}

### Organising Habits

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.14.29.png" alt="A list of my habits on Todoist" %}

My Habits project is basically where I live everyday. It has tasks from taking my vitamins (let‚Äôs strengthen that immune system yo!) to exercising. 

These tasks occur everyday or every two days and they‚Äôre sorted in different categories with priority flags on them.


### Using Labels

The [labels](https://youtu.be/Ekbpnu--uxQ) feature is a great way to ‚Äòlabel‚Äô specific tasks and allow them to interact even if they‚Äôre not in the same project. 

I don‚Äôt really use it that much in my day-to-day workflow. Still, when I do, I use it to plan my content creation by creating labels depending on the content format and assigning it to a task. The category text is colour-coded, making it easier to see if you want to look at your tasks at a glance. 

In the sidebar, you can filter tasks by the label it‚Äôs assigned on. Students (note to me when I join Year 12 in September) could find this helpful as they could create labels on the difficulty of particular topics to know what to prioritise. 

{% include components/line.html %}

And that‚Äôs how I use Todoist. ‚úÖ

Again, I‚Äôve tried many different to-do list apps. Out of all of them, Todoist is the best combination of features and great user experience. If you haven‚Äôt downloaded it, I‚Äôd recommend getting it [here](https://todoist.com/r/clark_narvas_yklnbb).
