_“What are you going to do today?”_

Unlike many non-COVID Year 11’s before 2020, my year has got a 100 day summer break (excluding the days we have to come in for small courses) 

It’s a lot of time! 

Throughout these 100 days, I want to start several good habits, try to end bad ones and keep myself generally sane and active. Here’s how I’ve been using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/clark_narvas_yklnbb) to keep myself accountable.

{% include components/heading.html text="A few features I love" %}

* Kanban Boards: It’s a feature copied and pasted from [Trello](https://trello.com/), and the implementation is really good here. I love how it’s another type of view alongside the normal list view. 

* Smart Language Detection: It can detect through what I write, the time, date or the number of occurrences I want a task to repeat without needing to go through a lot of context menus. It’s a really nifty feature that allows me to save time. 

* Priority Tasks: I use this to order my tasks and to eliminate excuses on what comes first.

* Karma: It gamifies tasks and is honestly just nice to look at.

### How I use Inbox

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.13.20.png" alt="My inbox with tasks in" description="Don't ask." %}

Inbox is where I put tasks specific to the day and don’t repeat. 

These tasks aren’t very complex or have any individual processes behind them, they’re bitesize reminders that simply remind me to do something _(eg. Bring bulletproof vest)_


### How I use Projects

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.13.45.png" alt="Ideas kanban board todoist" description="Kanban Boards are the best" %}

Many of them are organised as Kanban Boards in 3 sections: what I’m not doing, what I’m doing and what goal or task has been achieved. This might not work for every project and scenario but for what I’ve been using Todoist for, this works really well. 

While Todoist doesn’t have a task descriptions feature, it does have a comments feature and it works just as well, except it’s not as structured and you can see the date and time you’ve added it (which could be useful!)

### Organising Habits

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/blogposts/how-i-use-todoist/Screenshot 2021-06-22 at 22.14.29.png" alt="A list of my habits on Todoist" %}

My Habits project is basically where I live everyday. It has tasks from taking my vitamins (let’s strengthen that immune system yo!) to exercising. These tasks occur everyday or every two days and they’re placed in an order of importance.

I add notifications on each of the tasks which remind me if I ever end up dozing off and forgetting about it. 


### Using Labels

The [labels](https://youtu.be/Ekbpnu--uxQ) feature is a great way to ‘label’ specific tasks and allow different ones to interact even if they’re not in the same project. 

I don’t really use it that much in my day-to-day workflow. Still, when I do, I use it to plan my content creation by creating labels depending on the content format and assigning it to a task. The category text is colour-coded, making it easier to see if you want to look at your tasks at a glance. 

In the sidebar, you can filter tasks by the label it’s assigned on. Students (note to me when I join Year 12 in September) could find this helpful as they could create labels on the difficulty of particular topics to know what to prioritise. 

{% include components/line.html %}

And that’s how I use Todoist. ✅

I’ve tried many different to-do list apps. Out of all of them, Todoist is the best combination of features and great user experience. If you haven’t downloaded it, I’d recommend getting it [here](https://todoist.com/r/clark_narvas_yklnbb).

Do you already use Todoist? Tell me how you use it in the (recently added) comments below!
