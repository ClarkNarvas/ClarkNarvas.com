We clean our rooms; we clean our drawers and we throw away stuff we don‚Äôt need, but digitally we don‚Äôt seem to bother.

If our digital life was a room, the room would be filled with 10000+ unread emails, old social media accounts we don‚Äôt use anymore and apps that we haven‚Äôt used in months but we keep it ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.

So, here‚Äôs a little guide I put together to help you clean this mess up! ü§ì

{% include components/heading.html text="Your Apps" %}
{% include components/image.html url="/assets/oldsitearchive/uploads/2020/01/mobile-apps-collage-ss-1920.jpg" %}

Scroll through your phone and find apps that you don‚Äôt use and delete them, then find apps that you don‚Äôt feel like give you any value or wastes your time and delete them.

On Android, there are apps that can help you do this (arguably, you could say this is a ‚ÄúJust In Case‚Äù app). My preferred one is [Unused App Remover](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vs_unusedappremover), I like this app because it has no-thrills and it just gets the job done.

Any apps that you can‚Äôt delete, try and disable or hide them from your phone.

{% include components/heading.html text="Your Photos" %}

For this, I‚Äôd recommend you‚Äôd upload all your photos onto cloud storage so you‚Äôd be able to access them anywhere.

If you‚Äôre not a huge privacy geek like me and you really like the Google Eco-system, then I‚Äôd recommend [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com). It has unlimited photo storage (albeit, kinda compressed but you really can‚Äôt see the difference) and it has useful features such as facial recognition which will automatically group photos according to who is in the photo.

.
<i>[UPDATED 30/12/2020: Google is to discontinue free unlimited photos in March, there aren't any free photo alternatives.]</i>

Other alternatives are uploading all your photos to a traditional cloud storage platform such as [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) or just using [Apple iCloud](https://icloud.com), which is already quite integrated with iOS.

Now, scroll through your photos and delete duplicate images, weird screenshots you don‚Äôt need or random accidental selfies you‚Äôve taken.

{% include components/heading.html text="Your Notifications" %}

I never really paid attention to notifications before. I used to just let them build up, but what I‚Äôve found out is that, not only unnecessary notifications look really untidy, but they make you become less productive. Let‚Äôs fix that!

<b>On Android</b>

This may vary between devices due to Android versions and Android skins.

    Go into Settings
    Click Apps and Notifications
    Click ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù
    Click ‚ÄúSee all from last 7 days‚Äù
    Disable the ones you don‚Äôt click on or need

<b>ON iOS (iphones)</b>

This may vary between each iOS

    Go into Settings
    Click ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù
    Click on the apps you get unnecessary notifications from
    Hide them into the notification center or disable them completely

{% include components/heading.html text="Your Computer Files" %}

My computer files are the most messiest dump of ‚Äôdigital waste‚Äò you will probably ever see. Full of images, .exe files and a lot of After Effects project files. You‚Äôll probably be able to relate to an extent.

One step would be to put all your computer files on Cloud Storage, and using a sync client to integrate it with your File Explorer/Finder. The most popular Cloud Storage providers, such as Google Drive, Dropbox and iCloud (integrated into MacOS) should already have a sync client that you can use.

After doing this, you should re-evaluate all the files you have on your computer and think about whether or not you should move them onto cloud storage or delete them.

I‚Äôd then sort it all into folders that would act as little categories for all your files.

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/oldsitearchive/uploads/2020/02/image.png" alt="Files" %}
To do this I used MEGA, a privacy-first and encrypted Cloud Storage provider based in New Zealand that has plans that don‚Äôt break the bank and can be used on all devices.

This should remove all the clutter from your computer and should make it easier to navigate, not just on your computer but also on your mobile device.

{% include components/heading.html text="Social Media" %}

This is probably by far the most embarrassing one, I‚Äôm saying that from experience. üòÇ

<b>Twitter</b>

Take a trip back into memory lane and scroll through your Twitter feed and delete the tweets you don‚Äôt want anyone to see.

If you don‚Äôt wanna go through all of that, there are tools like TweetDelete that are able to delete all tweets or certain tweets from a time period.

<b>Facebook & Instagram </b>

On Facebook, there‚Äôs a tool called ‚ÄòLimit Past Posts‚Äô which will hide your current and past timeline posts. To find this, it‚Äôs in Settings > Privacy > Limit Past Posts. There are also Chrome extensions you can get like Social Book Post Manager, which can delete years worth of posts and images.

On Instagram, there are apps like Cleaner for Instagram which let you select how many photos you want deleted. If you want to keep your images, there is an archive button in the Instagram app.


{% include components/heading.html text="Emails" %}

This is the worst one.

My emails are mostly full of old email subscriptions I have never opened and loads of spam emails from companies that wanna give me ‚ÄòFREE SAMPLES‚Äô. Let‚Äôs solve that!

{% include components/image.html url="/assets/oldsitearchive/uploads/2020/02/image.png" alt="Get your FREE samples today spam email" description="Do anyone still believe these?" %}


The most manual way of doing this is to just scroll through your emails and then delete/unsubscribe the emails that you don‚Äôt really open or bring value to you.

To do that, it would be really labor intensive and it would take a long time as I have so many unread emails. Fortunately, there are apps like Cleanfox that can let you do that!

The app allows you to unsubscribe to mailing lists quickly. Swipe left to delete these emails or swipe right to unsubscribe from them, There is a keep button in the center in case you want to keep that mailing list and that email.

It also shows information on the amount of CO2 you have saved by unsubscribing to these emails and the amount of times you‚Äôve opened emails from an individual mailing list.

Congratulations! You‚Äôve successfully ‚Äòcleaned your room‚Äô. You should receive less spam emails, less notifications and less burden to your online footprint, vital in a time where technology is becoming a bigger bigger part of our lives.
